# Project: Creating a new way to access your home

With the advent of the internet of things, and services like the Nest, I felt there could be a service which could improve the experience of people accessing their homes. 

Having conducted 6 user interview with my target audience, I formed the below problem statement and personas, and began to create a service which sought to revolutionise how we might interact with our homes.

## Problem statement

I share a flat with 3 friends and my partner. We all have our own set of keys and whilst we all get on well we all have busy social lives and work 9:00-17:00 jobs. We all often lose our keys, and have to rely on others being in. Moreover it is hard to give people temporary access (be they guests, deliverymen etc.) because we we are so busy, and to access our place requires you to either have a physical set of keys or be let in by someone. 

********

Not being able to get in, or having to be there to let someone else in, can be really frustrating and throw all of your plans.

## Personas

**Gini - The Young Professional**

Having moved from New Zealand at the age of 24, Gini lives in a shared house with 4 others she met through spare room. They are all friendly but often unsure who is in, as all of them have quite intense jobs and busy social lives. 

Her house has been burgled twice in the last two years though the back window and front door being broken in.

Behaviours

* She often misplaces her keys has to be let in by a housemate. 
* Gini likes to party and so often arrives late home at night with or without keys.
* Gini likes shopping online and having things delivered as she often does not have time to go shopping.

Challenges

* She often has to rely on other people being in when she has forgotten her keys.
* Security is sometimes an issue as people often leave windows open.
* Replacing of keys after losing them or buying new locks is very expensive. Often no one is in the house to receive a delivery

Aims

* To be able to access her place whether or not she has her keys.
* To know that the house is secure and the windows are locked at any time.
* To be able to have things delivered whether or not she is there.

> Often..."only going home when I know someone is there to let me in"

**Ben and Anna - The Couple**

Ben (32) and Anna (37), have been living together for years in a flat with their dog ('Calvin'). Both have full time work in the city. 

They have a cleaner once a week and their building is having a lot of work at the moment - both people coming into the flat or being just outside the windows on scaffolding. 

Behaviours

* Ben and Anna often have deliveries - once a week. Sometimes this works being left with neighbours and other times not.
* They often let friends come to stay at theirs and have set up an Airbnb account to rent out their flat on the weekends they are not in town.
* Friends come by in order to dog-sit for them.

Challenges

* Transitioning of keys when people come to stay is often tricky - especially returning the keys.
* Quite trusting of people but would like some reassurance when stranger come around.
* Workmen come at the most inconvenient times. Often having to rebook/take time off work to let them in.

Aims

* To be able to give and take temporary access of their house to guests. 
* To be able to trust and have workmen/people over when they are away at work.
