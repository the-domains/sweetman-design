About James
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b8e3a24b-0ec6-4562-abe5-9a96278e25d8.jpg)

I am an experienced UX strategist, designer and product manager. Having co-founded and run my own successful start-up for 5 years, I now work as BMOgam's digital manager for Europe. 

Discovering what make people tick, and building products to match those needs is what I love.

Agency side I have handled end-to-end delivery of IT projects for local government, charities and client companies with multi-million pound turnovers. Client side I have developed platforms and strategies to both deliver on business goals and satisfy user needs.

I am a fast learner and passionate about UX. A keen follower of technological trends, I relish applying the latest thinking, and communicating its benefits to technical and non-technical stakeholders.
