# About James

I am an experienced UX strategist, designer and product manager. Having co-founded and run my own successful start-up for 5 years, I now work as BMOgam's digital manager for Europe. 

I have been responsible for end-to-end delivery of IT projects for client companies with multi-million pound turnovers, as well as local government and third sector organisations. Client side I have developed platforms and strategies to both deliver on business goals and satisfy user needs.

> Discovering what make people tick, and building products to match those needs is what I love. 

I am a fast learner and passionate about UX. A keen follower of technological trends, I relish applying the latest thinking, and communicating its benefits to technical and non-technical stakeholders. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/19010cad-f7ad-4c3e-8f76-d8ba6a7e4aed.png)
