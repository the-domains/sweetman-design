# Stickyboard: Your Neighbourhood noticeboard

Started in 2010, Stickyboard grew and changed over the years. It went through 4 core versions and each development was driven by lessons learnt from user research, testing and data derived from analytics and surveys.

User centric design techniques and usability research were intrinsic to developments. I would play the role of UX strategist, researcher and designer, agile project manager as well as front-end developer in the following process:

* Surveys and interviews were used to gain insights into user behaviour and form personas (in later versions customer behaviour on site and feedback was utilised)Using personas, user journeys were then mapped out and information architecture formed partly through card sorting and affinity maps.

* Prototypes - from lo-fi paper, and click through sketched interfaces on Pop through to hi-fi mock-ups- were used and tested on users for feedback.

* Alpha and beta release versions would be developed, tested and deployed with user feedback being sought.
