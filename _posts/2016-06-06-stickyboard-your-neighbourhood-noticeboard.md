# Stickyboard: Your Neighbourhood noticeboard

Started in 2010, Stickyboard grew and changed over the years. It went through 4 core versions and each development was driven by lessons learnt from user research, testing and data derived from analytics and surveys.

User centric design techniques and usability research were intrinsic to developments. I would play the role of UX strategist, researcher and designer, agile project manager as well as front-end developer in the following process:

**Surveys and interviews **were used to gain insights into user behaviour and form personas (in later versions customer behaviour on site and feedback was utilised)

**Using personas, user journeys** were then mapped out and information architecture formed partly through card sorting and affinity maps

**Prototypes** - from lo-fi paper, and click through sketched interfaces on Pop through to hi-fi mock-ups- were used and tested on users for feedback.

**Working in an Agile manner, Alpha release versions **would be developed, tested and deployed in the wild with user feedback being sought.

Before then working towards a final release such as this one...

This process would be refined and developed over the many noticeboard iterations. The noticeboard has grown and changed with developments in technology, behavioural design, and wants of users over the years: making it both a rewarding project and its roadmap a catalogue of developments in the field. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d2babdb7-2676-44d5-b517-d8912f04e5e9.png)
